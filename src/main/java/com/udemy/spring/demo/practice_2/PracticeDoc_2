Practice Activity #2 - Dependency Injection with XML Configuration

1. Define a new implementation for the FortuneService.

    a. When the getFortune() method is called it should return a random fortune from the array.

    b. Your fortune service should define three fortunes in an array.

2. Inject your new dependency into your Coach implementation.

3. Test your application to verify you are retrieving random fortunes.


**Practice Activity #3 - Bean Scopes with XML Configuration

1. Add bean scopes to your new Coach implementation that you created in one of the previous activities.

2. Test singleton scope and prototype scope as I did in the videos.

3. Verify that the bean scopes are being applied as desired.
